**Next Steps:**

In the next phase of development, we plan to integrate a cloud-based database to securely store and manage user information, ensuring data privacy and accessibility. This database will streamline user registration, appointment history, and other relevant details. Additionally, we'll work on implementing features that allow users to access exclusive training content provided by our client. This will involve setting up authentication mechanisms to grant authorized access to specific content based on user roles and permissions. Our goal is to create a seamless and personalized user experience, enabling users to efficiently access training materials and manage their appointments, fostering a stronger and more engaging relationship with our platform.
